# Keyboard, controller and mouse input

Bindings live in `input.ini`, next to `bbport.ini` (same folder rule: `BB_INPUT_CONFIG` if set,
otherwise the directory of `BB_CONFIG`/`bbport.ini`). If the file does not exist, bbport creates
it with the defaults below the first time the pad is opened.

The syntax is shadPS4's input config format (`output = input`, one input per line), so **a
Bloodborne config made for shadPS4** (`user/input_config/CUSA03173.ini` or `default.ini`) can be
copied over `input.ini` as is. Lines shadPS4 supports that bbport does not yet (key combos,
`key_toggle`, hotkeys other than the two below, `override_controller_color`, mouse-as-gyro,
mouse-as-touchpad) are skipped with one log warning per line; the rest of the file still loads.

Keyboard and controller bindings are always combined, not a fallback: the keyboard works
whether or not a controller is connected. When more than one source is bound to the same
output, buttons need only one source held; stick axes add their contributions together (and
are then clamped and passed through the deadzone), matching shadPS4. A stick value built from
keys and buttons is then ramped to its target over 33 ms, shadPS4's axis smoothing
(`UpdateAxisSmoothing`): a change sweeps the stick through the intermediate directions
(pressing D while releasing W turns through the diagonal) instead of teleporting in one frame;
the mouse-look contribution is exempt and applies instantly, like shadPS4's mouse writes.

## Outputs

| Output | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cross` `circle` `square` `triangle` | Face buttons |
| `l1` `r1` `l2` `r2` `l3` `r3` | Shoulders, triggers, stick clicks |
| `options` | Pause/menu |
| `pad_up` `pad_down` `pad_left` `pad_right` | D-pad |
| `touchpad_left` `touchpad_center` `touchpad_right` | A touch at that position on the pad |
| `axis_left_x_minus`/`_plus`, `axis_left_y_minus`/`_plus` | Left stick, one direction each |
| `axis_right_x_minus`/`_plus`, `axis_right_y_minus`/`_plus` | Right stick, one direction each |
| `axis_left_x` `axis_left_y` `axis_right_x` `axis_right_y` | A stick bound to a full physical axis (e.g. another stick) |
| `leftjoystick_halfmode` `rightjoystick_halfmode` | Holding this input halves that stick's deflection (walk) |
| `hotkey_toggle_mouse_to_joystick` | Key that toggles mouse look on/off (default `f7`) |
| `hotkey_reload_inputs` | Key that reloads this file without restarting (default `f8`) |

`l2`/`r2` also carry an analog value: a trigger bound to them passes its own reading; a key or
button snaps it to the maximum, same as the previous fixed layout.

## Inputs

- **Keyboard:** letters/digits (`a`..`z`, `0`..`9`), `f1`..`f12`, `space`, `enter`, `tab`,
  `backspace`, `escape`, `lshift`/`rshift`, `lctrl`/`rctrl`, `lalt`/`ralt`, arrow keys
  (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`), the numpad (`kp0`..`kp9`, `kpslash`, ...) and the usual
  punctuation keys (`comma`, `period`, `semicolon`, ...). Names follow what the key shows on the
  active keyboard layout, like shadPS4 — not its physical position.
- **Mouse buttons:** `leftbutton`, `middlebutton`, `rightbutton`, `sidebuttonback`,
  `sidebuttonforward`.
- **Mouse wheel:** `mousewheelup`, `mousewheeldown`, `mousewheelleft`, `mousewheelright`.
- **Controller buttons:** `cross`, `circle`, `square`, `triangle` (by position, not the printed
  letter), `l1`, `r1`, `l3`, `r3`, `options`, `pad_up`/`pad_down`/`pad_left`/`pad_right`,
  `back`/`share`, paddles (`lpaddle_high`, `l4`, `l5`, ...).
- **Controller axes:** `l2`, `r2` (triggers, 0..255), `axis_left_x`/`axis_left_y`/`axis_right_x`/
  `axis_right_y` (a full stick axis) and their half-axis forms (`axis_left_x_minus`,
  `axis_left_x_plus`, ...).
- **`unmapped`:** an explicit "no binding", different from leaving the line out.

Up to 4 bindings per output; a 5th is accepted and logged as ignored.

## Mouse look

```ini
mouse_to_joystick = right            # left | right; absent = mouse look does not exist
mouse_movement_params = 0.5, 1, 0.125   # deadzone_offset (unused, see below), speed, speed_offset
```

Mouse motion is smoothed over a short, fixed time window (so a fast flick or a quick 180-degree
turn stays responsive, while small, slow movements don't produce a jumpy camera) and then
converted into the chosen stick with a formula based on shadPS4's `EmulateJoystick`, normalized
so the result does not depend on the game's frame rate. `speed` scales sensitivity; `speed_offset`
adds a constant on top of it, raising the response for slow movements without affecting fast ones
much. `deadzone_offset` is parsed for compatibility with existing files but no longer affects the
camera (an earlier version of this formula used it as a startup floor; the launcher's
"Smoothness" slider was removed along with that).

**F7 toggles only this camera mapping** (F8 reloads the file), and it starts off: a
`mouse_to_joystick` line only makes the feature available, exactly like shadPS4, whose mouse
mode is off until F7. Mouse buttons and the wheel are independent of the toggle: they act
whenever the game owns the mouse (window focused, settings menu and text entry closed). With
look off, mouse motion is simply dropped, not banked — turning look back on never snaps the
camera with motion from while it was off. Clicking the window to give it focus never fires an
attack.

The F4 mousecam (the direct camera write) and this mouse-to-stick look both steer the camera
from the same mouse, so they are mutually exclusive: turning on one turns the other off. Use
whichever fits — F4 for the 1:1 direct-write camera, F7 for the shadPS4-style stick.

**Known limitation:** the stick is still a stick. Camera rotation saturates at the game's own
maximum turn speed and inherits its acceleration curve; this is not 1:1 mouse aim, by design —
it is the same tradeoff shadPS4 makes.

## Analog deadzone

```ini
analog_deadzone = leftjoystick, 1, 127   # device, inner, outer (1..127 each)
```

`device` is `leftjoystick`, `rightjoystick`, `l2` or `r2`. Below `inner` the output is 0; from
`inner` to `outer` it ramps up linearly; at or above `outer` it is fully deflected. The default
(`1, 127`) is effectively no deadzone, matching the behavior before this feature existed.

## Reserved keys

**Insert**, **Escape** (the settings menu) and **F9** (`BB_PAD_RECORD`) can never be bound to a
game output, and are rejected with a warning if a line tries. Whatever key currently toggles
mouse look or reloads the file (`f7`/`f8` by default, or whatever `hotkey_toggle_mouse_to_joystick`/
`hotkey_reload_inputs` were last set to) is reserved the same way.

## Default file

```ini
# bbport input (shadPS4 syntax: output = input, one input per line).
# A shadPS4 input config (user/input_config/CUSA03173.ini) can be copied over this file.
# F7 toggles mouse look, F8 reloads this file.

# Keyboard
cross = space
circle = lshift
square = e
triangle = v
l1 = 1
r1 = 3
l2 = r
r2 = f
l3 = z
r3 = q
r3 = c
options = enter
pad_up = i
pad_down = k
pad_left = j
pad_right = l
touchpad_left = tab
touchpad_right = backspace

axis_left_x_minus = a
axis_left_x_plus = d
axis_left_y_minus = w
axis_left_y_plus = s
axis_right_x_minus = left
axis_right_x_plus = right
axis_right_y_minus = up
axis_right_y_plus = down

# Hold to halve the left stick (walk): uncomment and pick a key
# leftjoystick_halfmode = lalt

# Mouse (uncomment mouse_to_joystick for mouse look; buttons work while focused)
# mouse_to_joystick = right
mouse_movement_params = 0.5, 1, 0.125
r1 = leftbutton
r2 = rightbutton
circle = sidebuttonback
square = sidebuttonforward

# Controller
cross = cross
circle = circle
square = square
triangle = triangle
l1 = l1
r1 = r1
l2 = l2
r2 = r2
l3 = l3
r3 = r3
options = options
touchpad_left = back
pad_up = pad_up
pad_down = pad_down
pad_left = pad_left
pad_right = pad_right
axis_left_x = axis_left_x
axis_left_y = axis_left_y
axis_right_x = axis_right_x
axis_right_y = axis_right_y

# Hotkeys
hotkey_toggle_mouse_to_joystick = f7
hotkey_reload_inputs = f8
```

Without an `input.ini`, this default reproduces the previous fixed layout, except: the keyboard
now works together with a controller instead of only without one, and **Q is lock-on (R3)**
instead of Triangle — **V is Triangle** now, and **C still works as R3** too. The mouse starts
off.

## Changing bindings while the game runs

Edit `input.ini` and press **F8** (or whatever `hotkey_reload_inputs` is set to). The whole file
is re-read and swapped in for the next pad sample — no restart needed. If the file cannot be
read (e.g. a typo left it without a closing line, or it was deleted mid-edit), the previous
bindings keep working and a warning is logged; the game is never left without any input config.
